Band-o-Matic
Thinkful Capstone Project 1

Band-o-matic pulls random elements from several different APIs to create a unique album cover for an imaginary band. The band name, 
album name and album art are independently sourced and each text element can be manipulated and customized using the app's controls.

Planned updates include download functionality, page-state url parsing and social media sharing.
